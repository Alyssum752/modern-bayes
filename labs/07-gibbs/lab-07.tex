\section{Agenda}

In this lab, we will deriving conditional distributions, code a Gibbs sampler, and analyze the output of the Gibbs sampler. 

Consider the following Exponential model for observation(s) $\bf{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n).$\footnote{Please note that in the attached data there are 40 observations, which can be found in \text{data-exponential.csv}.}:
$$ p(x|a,b) = a b \exp(- a b x) I(x>0),$$ where the $x_i$ are assumed to be iid for $i=1,\ldots n.$
and suppose the prior is 
$$ p(a,b) = \exp(- a - b)I(a,b>0). $$
You want to sample from the posterior $p(a,b|x_{1:n})$.  You may assume that $a=0.25, b=0.25.$

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the conditional distributions needed for implementing a Gibbs sampler.
\item Code up your own Gibbs sampler using part (a).
\item (5 pts) Plot a histogram or a density estimate of the estimated posterior using (b). 
\item (10 pts) How do you know that your estimated posterior in (c) is reliable? Provide convergence diagnostic plots and commentary. 
\end{enumerate}
