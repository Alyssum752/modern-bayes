\begin{enumerate}
\item 3.14, part d in Hoff. (Unit information prior). 
\item (Normal-Normal)  Derive the posterior predictive density $p(x_{n +1}|x_{1:n})$ for the Normal--Normal model covered in lecture. Hint: There is an easy way to do this and a hard way. To make the problem easier, consider writing $X_{n+1} = \btheta + Z$ given $x_{1:n}$, where $Z\sim\N(0,\lambda^{-1})$.)
\item Work through section 10.3 in the Hoff book. (Metropolis). 
\end{enumerate}

Make sure that you're familiar with Lab 6.
