Welcome to STA 360, Fall 2020! 

The readings/preparations for the class can be found at the very bottom of this file for reference. These are subject to change and will be updated as the course progresses. 

This is a tenative course schedule given that Duke is undergoing re-registration and we currently do not have a class time or lab time. I am outlining the first few weeks of the semester and providing links regarding resources to help you prepare for the class in advance with many resources to help you be prepared for the start of the semester! I look forward to having everyone in class very much and getting to know all of you!

## Tenative Course Schedule 

The syllabus is a comprehensive place regarding expectations for STA 360. 

[Syllabus](https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/blob/master/syllabus/syllabus-sta360-fall20.pdf)

The Google group is a place where starting on the first day of class, you can post a question regarding lecture, lab, or a homework assignment so that everyone can see it. 

[Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bayes20)

Sakai will be used so you can see your grades throughout the semester. Homework submissions will be uploaded here on Sakai as well.

# Suggested Readings

## Hoff

I suggest that you read all of Hoff and you will be expected to have read the readings that correspond with the notes before 
coming to class. There are also notes that I have written under readings/ that you may find helping as additional resources. 

## Required Material

Before starting the course for the fall semester, I would highly recommend review the pre-req material for the course on the [syllabus](https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/blob/master/syllabus/syllabus-sta360-fall20.pdf). Given the shortened semester, please make sure that you are 100 percent comfortable with the pre-req material before taking STA 360. If you have any questions regarding this, please reach out to me as soon as possible.

## github

Please learn github if you're not already familiar as this is where the course resources are located. https://lab.github.com/). Homework releases and submissions will be done on Sakai. 


## Other

If Sakai is problematic for you due to your location, please let me know in advance, so I can think of alternative options, such as uploads via github. If you are having internet issues, please let me know as well. 


## Other readings :

- Credible Intervals): Cred intervals are covered on pages 52 and 267 of Hoff.
