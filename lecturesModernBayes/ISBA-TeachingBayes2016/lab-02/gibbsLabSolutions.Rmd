## Exponential Model

- Consider the following Exponential model for multiple observation(s) $x = (x_1,\ldots,x_n)$. 
- Please note that in the attached data there are 40 observations

$$ p(x|a,b) = a b \exp(- a b x) I(x>0)$$

and suppose the prior is 

$$ p(a,b) = \exp(- a - b)I(a,b>0). $$

You want to sample from the posterior $p(a,b|x)$.  

## Goals and Tasks

- Task 1: Find the conditional distributions needed for implementing a Gibbs sampler.
- Task 2: Code up your own Gibbs sampler in Task 1.
- Task 3: Plot a histogram or a density estimate of the estimated posterior in Task 2. 
- Task 4: How do you know that your estimated posterior in Task 3 is reliable? Provide convergence diagnostic plots and commentary. 

## Task 1: Conditional distributions
